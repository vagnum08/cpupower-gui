# Cpupower-gui configuration

cpupower-gui first tries to read the configuration from `/etc/cpupower_gui.conf`.
Then it will read any `.conf` file in this directory (`/etc/cpupower_gui.d/`)
in alphabetical order. The options defined on the last read file take precedence.

For example, if there are two files, named `10-config.conf` and `20-overrides.conf`, the shared options from the first will be overridden.

Simillarly, files found in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cpupower_gui/`, which usually points to `~/.config/cpupower_gui/`, will take precedence over the system-wide ones.


# Profiles

Profile files are text files with a `.profile` extension.
The file must start with the following line:
```
# name: My_Profile
```

If profile name contains spaces it must be quoted like:
```
# name: "My awesome profile"
```

The profile settings have the following format:
```
# CPU MIN MAX GOVERNOR ONLINE(Optional)
0-2  2500 3000 performance y
```
The options are separated with whitespace (spaces/tabs).

For the cpu option valid values are the either a number or a range.
For example, `0-2` sets the cores 0, 1, 2 (that is the first three cores).

For the minimum and maximum frequency the values must be the clock frequency in MHz.
If you want to omit a value use `-` and it will be set to the hardware frequency limit.

For the governor value, either use the name of the governor or `-`.
If `-` is used, then the first available governor will be selected.

Lastly, for online option, you can omit the value or use:
- `y`, `yes`, `true`, `1` to enable.
- `n`, `no`, `false`, `0` to disable.

An example profile is available at `/etc/cpupower_gui.d/my_profile.profile.ex
